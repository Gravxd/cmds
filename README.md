# discordjs-unban

This command is usable in the v11 version of discord.js.

You can change it up etc with embeds and different types of permissions like if the member is banned however this is the basics.

You don't need to be a smartass and comment on the format, it works and i only do this to help people.

Thanks & enjoy!
